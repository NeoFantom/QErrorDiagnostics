    type: ensemble_avg
    assumptions: |
      Chip is connected and readout line is accessible.
    sweep:

    monitor:
      - readout signal strength
    procedure: |
      Sweep the readout frequency across a predefined range while monitoring the readout signal strength.
      Optionally adjust the coupler bias or readout signal power to improve signal clarity.
      Identify peaks in the response amplitude to locate resonances.

  - name: readout resonator spectroscopy
    id: ro-resonator-spec
    type: ensemble_avg
    assumptions: |
      Already know the approximate value of the readout resonator's frequency.
    sweep:
      - readout frequency
      - power (optional)

      - readout signal strength
    procedure: |
      Perform a fine sweep of the readout frequency around the approximate resonator frequency.
      Optionally adjust the coupler bias or readout signal power to refine the measurement.
      In the high power regime, a Lorentzian dip or peak appears around the resonator frequency and may broaden with power.
      In the low power regime, dispersive coupling to the qubit causes a state-dependent shift of the resonator frequency, which fades as the power increases due to saturation.
      Monitor the response amplitude to precisely locate the resonator frequency (and power, if not emprically decided).
    post_operations: |
      Update the readout frequency & power in the registry for subsequent experiments.
