# Discussion with Chai

1. order of experiments
1. access level of noise diagnosis experiments

1. data that we need to identify some noise sources

Thought:

Assume a most complex control model, where everything is tunable, all couplers are present, all controls are available and independent.
If something is defied by a specific chip, remove the node and make it trivial.
