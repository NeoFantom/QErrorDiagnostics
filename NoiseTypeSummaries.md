# Systematic Diagnosis of Noise in Superconducting Qubits

Superconducting (SC) qubits are unavoidably subject to various noise sources that degrade their coherence and gate fidelity. Understanding and characterizing these noise sources is critical for improving qubit performance. Below we classify the types of noise in SC qubits and discuss, for each category, the physical origin, diagnostic methods, and mitigation techniques, emphasizing experimental approaches and recent literature.

## 1. Classification of Noise in Superconducting Qubits

SC qubit noise can be broadly grouped by physical origin and by how it impacts the qubit’s state or operations. Key categories include: 

- **Intrinsic decoherence** (energy relaxation and dephasing): Stochastic interactions with the environment cause qubit excitations to decay (T<sub>1</sub> processes) or qubit phases to randomize (T<sub>2</sub> dephasing). The environment includes material defects, electromagnetic modes, and other uncontrolled degrees of freedom.
- **Control and gate errors**: Imperfections in the pulses used for single- and two-qubit gates (e.g. calibration errors, waveform distortions) and unwanted interactions (crosstalk) can introduce gate inaccuracies beyond intrinsic decoherence.
- **Leakage errors**: Population escaping the two-level computational subspace into higher excited states of the qubit (or other systems) during gates or due to environmental disturbances.
- **State preparation and initialization errors**: Incomplete initialization of the qubit in the ground state (residual excited-state population due to insufficient cooling or reset) leading to errors at the start of computation.
- **Measurement (readout) errors**: Imperfect readout of the qubit state, caused by finite signal-to-noise, qubit transitions during measurement, or readout crosstalk.
- **Correlated and crosstalk errors**: Errors that are not independent for each qubit, including spatially or temporally correlated error events (e.g. common-mode noise, unintended qubit-qubit couplings, or bursts of energy depositing in multiple qubits simultaneously).

It is also useful to distinguish **incoherent (stochastic)** errors from **coherent** errors. Incoherent errors (e.g. random T<sub>1</sub> decay) manifest as irreversible mixing of states, while coherent errors (e.g. consistent over-rotation by a control pulse) are systematic and in principle can be corrected by calibration or echo techniques. Moreover, noise can be **Markovian** (memoryless exponential decoherence) or **non-Markovian** (having memory, leading to non-exponential or correlated decay). In practice, SC qubits experience a combination of these noise types. Table 1 of Krantz *et al.* (2019) summarizes common physical noise sources in transmon qubits: for example, **charge noise** arises from fluctuating two-level charge traps in dielectrics, **flux noise** from stochastic flips of paramagnetic surface defects, **photon shot noise** from residual cavity photons, **quasiparticle excitations** from broken Cooper pairs, and **two-level system (TLS) defects** in materials ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=Magnetic%20Flux%20Noise%20%20,resonator%20decay%20rate%20number%20fluctuations)) ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=rough%20a%20qubit%20junction%20,the%20phonon%20or%20quasiparticle%20bath)). Each of these processes couples to the qubit either through its charge degree of freedom, flux (current) bias, or via the resonator, leading to relaxation or dephasing depending on the frequency spectrum of the noise.

**Diagnosing noise by type:** Experimentally, one typically performs a suite of measurements to identify dominant noise mechanisms. For instance, measuring energy relaxation time T<sub>1</sub> versus qubit frequency can reveal coupling to discrete TLS defects (sharp drops in T<sub>1</sub> at certain frequencies indicate resonant energy absorption by a TLS) ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=the%20TLS%20frequency%20,well%20as%20reveal%20additional%20diffusive)). Likewise, measuring dephasing (T<sub>2</sub>) with and without echo pulses can indicate the presence of 1/f-type low-frequency noise (echo cancels slow noise, so a much longer T<sub>2, echo</sub> compared to free induction T<sub>2}^* indicates dominant slow noise). Noise spectroscopy techniques apply tailored pulse sequences (like Ramsey sequences, spin echoes, CPMG multipulse sequences) to probe the noise power spectral density, effectively using the qubit as a noise sensor ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=Characterizing%20and%20modeling%20noise%20using,The%20control)). By fitting these decay curves, one can distinguish white noise (yielding exponential decays) from 1/f noise (often yielding Gaussian or non-exponential decays) ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=Table%201%20%20presents%20the,exponential%2C%20and%20for%20such)) ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=For%20noise%20spectra%2C%20the%20phase,%28%2041)). In multi-qubit devices, special protocols are used to detect correlated errors or crosstalk (for example, simultaneous randomized benchmarking or gate set tomography with crosstalk terms) as discussed in Section 7.

Below, we examine each noise category in detail, with methods to identify and characterize them and notes on mitigation strategies from recent research.

## 2. Noise from Energy Relaxation and Dephasing (T₁ and T₂)

**Origin and mechanisms:** Energy relaxation (characterized by T<sub>1</sub>) and pure dephasing (characterized by T<sub>φ</sub>, with T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> often limited by both T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>φ</sub>) are caused by interactions between the qubit and its environment. In superconducting qubits, a dominant T<sub>1</sub> mechanism is coupling to microscopic two-level system (TLS) defects in device materials: these TLS (e.g. in amorphous dielectrics or interfaces) can resonantly absorb the qubit’s energy and dissipate it as phonons or other excitations ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=rough%20a%20qubit%20junction%20,the%20phonon%20or%20quasiparticle%20bath)). Such TLS defects produce a characteristic Lorentzian noise spectrum around their resonance frequencies and can cause abrupt drops in T<sub>1</sub> when the qubit frequency is near a TLS frequency. Moreover, TLS themselves can fluctuate in frequency (an **interacting TLS bath**), causing telegraphic and 1/f noise in qubit parameters ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=the%20TLS%20frequency%20,well%20as%20reveal%20additional%20diffusive)). Another T<sub>1</sub> source is **quasiparticle excitations** in the superconductor: stray nonequilibrium electrons can tunnel across the Josephson junction, dissipating energy ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=number%20fluctuations,Transverse)). Quasiparticles can be introduced by cosmic rays or background radiation hits that break Cooper pairs. Indeed, cosmic-ray or gamma-ray impacts can produce bursts of quasiparticles that *dramatically* shorten T<sub>1</sub> across many qubits simultaneously ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=This%20paper%20explains%20how%20cosmic,the%20effects%20of%20radiation%2C%20but)). For example, a single ionizing event in a modern transmon chip can collapse T<sub>1</sub> from ~100 µs to ~1 µs over a region of the chip for milliseconds, introducing large correlated relaxation errors ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=This%20paper%20explains%20how%20cosmic,the%20effects%20of%20radiation%2C%20but)). 

Dephasing (loss of phase coherence) is caused by fluctuations in the qubit’s transition frequency. **Low-frequency flux noise** – believed to originate from surface magnetic spin defects randomly flipping on the superconductor surfaces – induces fluctuations in the qubit frequency (especially for flux-tunable qubits), resulting in 1/f-type dephasing ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=Magnetic%20Flux%20Noise%20%20,resonator%20decay%20rate)). Similarly, **charge noise** (fluctuating trapped charges or offset voltages) can modulate the frequency of charge-sensitive qubits. Transmon qubits are engineered to be charge-insensitive at the sweet spot, but residual second-order effects of charge fluctuations can still contribute to slow dephasing drift. **Critical current noise** (fluctuations in Josephson junction properties) is another slow noise source that effectively shifts qubit frequency. At higher frequencies, **photon shot noise** in the readout resonator (due to residual thermal photons or amplifier backaction) produces qubit phase noise via the dispersive coupling ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=rconductors%2C%20resulting%20in%20random%20fluctuations,quasiparticle%20lifetime)). Each of these noise sources contributes to dephasing if their spectral components include zero or low frequency, causing the qubit phase to wander.

**Diagnostic methods:** The primary measures of decoherence are the relaxation time *T*<sub>1</sub> (measured by excited-state population decay) and coherence times *T*<sub>2</sub> (measured by Ramsey fringes for T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> and echo sequences for T<sub>2</sub>). By comparing T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> (no echo) to T<sub>2</sub><sup>echo</sup>, one can infer the presence of slow noise: if echo substantially prolongs coherence, low-frequency noise (like 1/f flux noise) is dominant. For example, a transmon at its flux *sweet spot* (insensitive to first-order flux fluctuations) will often have T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> ≈ T<sub>1</sub> (indicating white or high-frequency noise limit), whereas off the sweet spot it may have T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> ≪ T<sub>1</sub> due to flux noise-induced dephasing. Noise spectroscopy protocols use sequences such as Hahn echoes, CPMG pulse trains, or more complex dynamically decoupled sequences to map out the noise spectrum ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=Characterizing%20and%20modeling%20noise%20using,The%20control)). By varying the spacing of echo pulses (thereby varying the filter function that weights different noise frequencies), experimenters can back out an approximate noise spectral density. This has been demonstrated, for instance, by measuring coherence under different echo spacing and using the data to reconstruct the underlying 1/f noise spectrum ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=Characterizing%20and%20modeling%20noise%20using,The%20control)). In addition, monitoring T<sub>1</sub> over time can reveal fluctuations that implicate specific mechanisms. A landmark study by Müller *et al.* observed T<sub>1</sub> fluctuations in a transmon consistent with a single near-resonant TLS switching its frequency; Klimov *et al.* later used a tunable qubit to track individual TLS “hopping” in and out of resonance, confirming an *interacting TLS* model of 1/f dielectric noise ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=the%20TLS%20frequency%20,well%20as%20reveal%20additional%20diffusive)) ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=determine%20properties%20of%20the%20TLS,diffusive%20motion%20of%20the%20TLS)). In practice, one might sweep a qubit’s transition frequency (by applying flux bias) and look for **T₁ spectroscopic dips**, which pinpoint coherent TLS defects ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=the%20TLS%20frequency%20,well%20as%20reveal%20additional%20diffusive)). Temperature dependence studies can also diagnose mechanisms: if T<sub>1</sub> degrades rapidly with temperature, thermal quasiparticles or blackbody radiation may be at play ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=This%20paper%20explains%20how%20cosmic,the%20effects%20of%20radiation%2C%20but)).

**Mitigation techniques:** Mitigating T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub> noise involves both materials engineering and circuit design. To reduce dielectric TLS losses, researchers employ better materials and interfaces (e.g. removing surface oxides, annealing, using amorphous dielectrics with fewer defects) ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=resonator%20,are%20no%20individual%20qubit%20drive)) ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=lines%2C%20nor%20any%20qubit,30%20A%20detailed)). Participations of lossy interfaces can be minimized by device geometry (e.g. using trenching around capacitors or vacuum gaps) ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=resonator%20,are%20no%20individual%20qubit%20drive)). Qubits can be designed to be first-order insensitive to certain noise: for instance, transmons at the sweet spot are insensitive to first-order charge and flux noise ([Decoherence benchmarking of superconducting qubits | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0168-5#:~:text=and%20the%20absence%20of%20magnetic,In%20addition%2C%20both%20the%20spectral)), and fluxonium qubits distribute current to reduce sensitivity to critical current noise.  Operating at an optimal bias point (sweet spot) whenever possible greatly improves dephasing times by suppressing the effect of 1/f flux noise. To combat **photon noise**, resonators are engineered with low thermal occupancy (using strongly attenuated input lines and cold filters) and often with Purcell filters that decouple qubits from resonator noise outside the qubit frequency band. Quasiparticle poisoning is mitigated by adding quasiparticle traps (normal-metal pads) on the chip to capture and sink quasiparticles before they diffuse to the qubit ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=Error,mechanism%20can%20be%20reduced%20by)). In fact, to address cosmic-ray-induced bursts, techniques like adding high-bandgap capping layers or phonon traps have been proposed to downconvert and confine phonon energy ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=superconducting%20qubits%20by%20modeling%20the,state)). Dynamical decoupling (applying continuous or periodic pulses to average out low-frequency noise) is another powerful approach – e.g. applying a continuous driving field to dress the qubit can refocus certain slow noise, and multi-echo sequences can extend *T*<sub>2</sub> by orders of magnitude if 1/f noise is the limiting factor. Indeed, by tailoring decoupling sequences to the measured noise spectrum, one can optimally filter out dominant noise frequencies ([Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.00679v1#:~:text=Characterizing%20and%20modeling%20noise%20using,The%20control)). Finally, improving cryogenic shielding (to block external magnetic or radiation noise) and even operating the quantum processor underground or with radiation shielding have been explored to reduce quasiparticle bursts ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=This%20paper%20explains%20how%20cosmic,the%20effects%20of%20radiation%2C%20but)).

## 3. Gate-Induced Errors (Single-Qubit and Two-Qubit Gates)

High-fidelity quantum gates on SC qubits are challenging due to both decoherence during the gate operation and control imperfections. Modern single-qubit gates can achieve error rates below $10^{-3}$ (0.1%) and two-qubit gates around a few $10^{-3}$ or better, but reaching these fidelities requires careful control engineering ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=remains%20a%20challenge,50%20Further%20improvement%20in%20the)). The two main contributors to gate errors are: (1) **intrinsic decoherence during the gate** (if $T_1$ or $T_2$ is not much longer than the gate time, some probability of error is inevitable), and (2) **control errors**, including calibration errors, pulse distortions, crosstalk to other qubits, and leakage out of the qubit subspace (addressed in Section 4).

**Single-qubit gate errors:** These are typically driven by microwave pulses resonant with the qubit. If the qubit has coherence times in the 50–100 µs range, a typical 20 ns gate has an incoherent error on the order of $2 \times 10^{-4}$ (from T<sub>1</sub> decay or dephasing during the gate). To approach this theoretical limit, control pulses must be extremely well-calibrated to avoid over- or under-rotation. Systematic pulse-area errors (e.g. a slight amplitude miscalibration leading to a 1% rotation error) will manifest as coherent errors that accumulate with repeated operations. A common way to diagnose such systematic errors is to apply a gate many times in sequence (for example, apply 100 X gates in a row and see if the state drifts away from the expected result). Coherent errors will cause oscillatory deviations (e.g. the Bloch vector rotates off-axis gradually), whereas purely incoherent errors would simply cause a loss of state fidelity without a clear oscillation. **Randomized Benchmarking** (RB) is an important protocol used to measure average gate error robustly: by applying long random sequences of Cliffords (composed of the elementary gates) and measuring the survival probability, one extracts an average error per gate that includes both decoherent and control errors. Interleaved RB can isolate the error of a specific gate type. In single-qubit RB, if the error per gate is notably higher than what one would expect from T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub> alone, it indicates control imperfections. For instance, early experiments found phase errors due to AC Stark shifts as a dominant contribution; the adoption of DRAG (Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate) pulse shaping significantly reduced these phase errors ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=non,QEC)), pushing single-qubit fidelities above 99.9% ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=on%20reducing%20phase%20errors%2C%20be%02cause,detrimental%20for%20er%02ror%20correcting%20codes)). Today, single-qubit gate errors are often limited by residual leakage or by slight crosstalk rather than the qubit’s own decoherence. Using *tomography*-based methods (gate set tomography), researchers can even distinguish coherent control errors (which appear as consistent over/under rotations or axis tilts) from stochastic errors ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=match%20at%20L168%20which%20is,to%20understand%20and%20improve%20hardware)). A *unitarity* metric (via unitarity benchmarking) can quantify the coherence of gate errors, helping diagnose whether an error is mostly random noise or a correctable systematic error.

Mitigation of single-qubit gate errors involves **pulse optimization and calibration**. DRAG pulses, which add derivative and quadrature components to the Gaussian drive pulse, are widely used to minimize leakage to the $|2\rangle$ state and cancel AC Stark shifts, thereby reducing both leakage and phase errors ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=non,QEC)). Sophisticated calibration routines (often automated in modern labs) adjust pulse amplitude, frequency, and phase to null any small rotation errors and to correct any cross-drive effects on neighboring qubits. These calibrations often use iterative “Ramsey” or “echo” sequences on the qubit to zero out phase accumulation, and repeated gate sequences (like $X^{N}$ with large $N$) to tune up the amplitude. **Crosstalk compensation** can be applied at the control waveform level: for example, if driving qubit A causes a spurious small rotation on qubit B, one can deliberately apply a slight counter-rotation on B (or pre-distort the drive waveform) to cancel it ([Crosstalk diagnosis for the next generation of quantum processors – Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/views/qv-2020-10-29-46/#:~:text=crosstalk%20is%20to%20fully%20characterise,because%20the%20effort%20of%20characterising)). This kind of active compensation requires characterizing the crosstalk error accurately (see Section 7). Another mitigation route is to shorten gate durations to reduce exposure to decoherence, but too-short pulses can cause spectral broadening (leading to leakage or driving spectator modes). Thus, an optimal gate time is often found that balances these factors. Research continues into more advanced control schemes like composite pulses and optimal control theory to reach even lower error rates.

**Two-qubit gate errors:** Two-qubit gates (entangling gates like CZ, iSWAP, or cross-resonance CNOT) are typically slower and more error-prone than single-qubit gates. They introduce additional error channels: leakage on either qubit (since multi-qubit gates often involve higher energy levels or strong drives), **spectator errors** on idle qubits, and control crosstalk through the coupling mechanism. Diagnosing two-qubit gate errors often starts with **interleaved RB on the two-qubit gate** to get its average error rate. If the average error is, say, 1%, one then seeks to break that down into components. Leakage during the gate can be detected by measuring population in non-computational states post-gate (some experiments perform a brief tomography to detect any occupation of $|2\rangle$ on either qubit after a CZ gate). Spectator qubit phase errors, such as unintended $ZZ$ interactions, can be diagnosed by performing Ramsey experiments on a spectator qubit while a two-qubit gate is applied on its neighbor – any acquired phase indicates an unintended conditional shift. For example, an always-on $ZZ$ coupling will cause the non-target qubit to accumulate a phase if its partner is in $|1\rangle$. Such $ZZ$ couplings (often on the order of a few hundred kHz in fixed-coupling transmon architectures) are a well-known noise source that contributes to two-qubit gate errors and idle errors. In systems like IBM’s fixed-frequency transmons using cross-resonance (CR) gates, the CR drive induces not only the desired $ZX$ interaction but also spurious single-qubit $Z$ rotations and $ZZ$ terms; these are typically corrected by calibrating additional pulses or echo sequences into the gate operation. For instance, applying an echoed CR (reversing the roles of control and target halfway through) can cancel out the unwanted $Z$ rotations on the target and control qubits. Gate set tomography experiments have identified such coherent two-qubit crosstalk errors and helped quantify them ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=An%20important%20class%20of%20errors,characterizing%20such%20errors%20are%20now)) ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=We%20used%20simultaneous%20gate%20set,a%20hierarchy%20of%20models%20to)).

Key experimental protocols for characterizing two-qubit gate noise include **simultaneous RB** (running RB on two qubits in parallel to see if error rates increase compared to separate RB, which signals crosstalk) and specialized **parity measurements** (creating a Bell state and measuring its parity oscillation can expose certain coherent errors). In one study, *simultaneous gate set tomography* was used to fully map out how a gate on qubit A affected qubit B and vice versa, finding significant cross-couplings on both a transmon and an ion-trap device ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=We%20used%20simultaneous%20gate%20set,a%20hierarchy%20of%20models%20to)). They could distinguish whether the crosstalk error was mostly coherent or stochastic and at what weight (how many qubits involved) ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=match%20at%20L168%20which%20is,to%20understand%20and%20improve%20hardware)) ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=We%20used%20simultaneous%20gate%20set,a%20hierarchy%20of%20models%20to)).

**Mitigation techniques:** Two-qubit gate fidelities have improved dramatically by mitigating specific error sources. For static $ZZ$ coupling, one approach is to **echo it out**: during idle periods or even during multi-qubit operations, applying periodic $\pi$ pulses to one qubit can refocus the $ZZ$ interaction (as long as it is longitudinal). Alternatively, tunable coupler schemes have been introduced where the effective coupling can be turned off except when an interaction is needed. For instance, a tunable coupler between transmons can be biased to near-zero coupling during idle times, suppressing unwanted entanglement, and quickly biased to a non-zero coupling to execute a CZ gate. Such couplers have enabled two-qubit gate errors below 0.5%. For CR gates on fixed-frequency qubits, the error budget is improved by calibrating **compensation tones**: e.g. a drive on the target qubit to cancel Stark shifts, or adjusting the amplitude and phase of the CR drive to minimize residual excitations. Pulse shaping (similar to DRAG) can mitigate leakage on CZ gates – e.g. using an adiabatic pulse that slowly approaches the avoided crossing with the $|11\rangle$–$|02\rangle$ state and then retreats, instead of a sudden pulse, reduces non-adiabatic excitations of $|02\rangle$. Advanced optimal control methods (GRAPE, etc.) have been used to design pulse envelopes that implement the gate with minimal leakage or spectator error ([Leakage reduction in fast superconducting qubit gates via optimal ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00346-2#:~:text=Leakage%20reduction%20in%20fast%20superconducting,limit%20the%20usability%20of)) ([State leakage during fast decay and control of a superconducting ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00357-z#:~:text=,pulse%20transfers%20the%20leakage)). Another important strategy is **frequency allocation** in multi-qubit arrays: by arranging qubit frequencies carefully, one avoids harmful resonance coincidences (such as a qubit’s $|1\rangle \to |2\rangle$ transition being on resonance with another’s $|0\rangle \to |1\rangle$ transition, which could cause swap errors during a CZ pulse). Experimental teams also mitigate two-qubit errors by improving coherence (since a fraction of two-qubit gate error is simply decoherence during the operation). Indeed, as coherence improves, two-qubit gate fidelities have pushed closer to the 99.9% range ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=remains%20a%20challenge,50%20Further%20improvement%20in%20the)), which is around the error correction threshold. Ensuring that gates are **robust to crosstalk** is an ongoing challenge; methods like **cross-talk cancellation matrices** (characterizing all pairwise microwave interference and inverting that matrix in software) are being deployed in large systems. In Section 7 we discuss crosstalk and correlated errors in more detail, as these cut across gate operations and decoherence.

## 4. Leakage Out of the Computational Subspace

Leakage errors occur when the qubit state exits the $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$ computational basis and occupies a non-computational level or state (for a transmon, these are the $|2\rangle, |3\rangle, \dots$ levels; in general it could also mean escaping to a different mode or environmental state). Leakage is especially concerning because most quantum error correction codes are not designed to handle errors outside the qubit subspace – a leaked qubit can invalidate syndrome measurements and spread errors to other qubits until it relaxes back or is reset ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20leakage%20errors%20are%20highly,error%20detection%20cy%02cles%20and%20propagated)). In superconducting qubits, leakage is typically a coherent process induced by control pulses that have spectral components resonant with a higher transition. For example, a naive square pulse resonant with the $|0\rangle\to|1\rangle$ transition also has frequency components that can drive the $|1\rangle\to|2\rangle$ transition (since the transmon’s levels are not exactly harmonic but are closer than in an ideal two-level system). Similarly, a fast two-qubit gate pulse (such as a CZ implemented by a fast flux bias) can non-adiabatically excite a qubit to $|2\rangle$. Additionally, some leakage can occur via *incoherent processes*: e.g. a spurious excitation due to absorption of a high-energy photon could take the qubit from $|0\rangle$ directly to $|2\rangle$ (this was observed as “incoherent heating” causing a baseline leakage even when control pulses were optimized) ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=characterize%20single%20qubit%20gates%20in,incoherent%20heating%20of%20the%20qubit)).

**Origin and examples:** During single-qubit $X/Y$ gates, the main leakage path is $|1\rangle \to |2\rangle$ excitation. For a transmon with anharmonicity $\alpha \approx -200$ MHz, a typical Gaussian pulse of 10–20 ns has a spectrum wide enough to significantly drive the $|1\rangle$–$|2\rangle$ transition unless countermeasures are taken. For two-qubit gates: a CZ gate often involves bringing the $|11\rangle$ state close to $|02\rangle$ (or $|20\rangle$) to accumulate a conditional phase; if the interaction is too fast or too strong, population can swap into $|02\rangle$ (one qubit leaking to $|2\rangle$). In a cross-resonance gate, leakage can occur if the drive power is too high, causing the target qubit to absorb two photons (an off-resonant drive could in principle pump it to $|2\rangle$). Beyond the transmon’s own levels, leakage can also refer to leaving the qubit mode entirely – for instance, excitations could leak into a parasitic mode or resonator (though this is usually encompassed in T<sub>1</sub> errors rather than “leakage” per se). In the context of error correction, **leakage is particularly harmful** because a data qubit that leaks to $|2\rangle$ can cause a cascade of faults: any two-qubit gate or parity check involving that qubit will behave unexpectedly (it might impart random phases on the other qubit) ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20leakage%20errors%20are%20highly,error%20detection%20cy%02cles%20and%20propagated)). Leaked states can be long-lived (a transmon in $|2\rangle$ can have a lifetime comparable to $|1\rangle$ or even longer if $|2\rangle$ has different loss mechanisms), so the error can persist across multiple gate cycles ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=leakage%20states%20can%20be%20as,critical%20importance%20for%20realizing%20QEC)). Experimental QEC demonstrations have indeed observed that a single leakage event can persist for many cycles and propagate errors to multiple neighboring qubits ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20leakage%20errors%20are%20highly,error%20detection%20cy%02cles%20and%20propagated)). For example, in a 9-qubit repetition code, a leaked qubit led to correlated errors until it decayed or was reset ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=leakage%20states%20can%20be%20as,critical%20importance%20for%20realizing%20QEC)).

**Diagnosing leakage:** Detecting leakage requires measurement beyond the two-level subspace. Many experiments use a dispersive readout that is sensitive primarily to the $|0\rangle$ vs $|1\rangle$ state; however, it is possible to calibrate the readout to distinguish the $|2\rangle$ state as well (since $|2\rangle$ causes a different frequency shift of the resonator). Chen *et al.* (Martinis group) demonstrated a leakage measurement by using a slightly modified dispersive readout that could discriminate $|2\rangle$ from $|0/1\rangle$ ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=errors%20is%20critically%20important%20for,With%20the)). They integrated this into randomized benchmarking: after each random sequence, they measured whether the qubit was in $|0/1\rangle$ or had leaked to $|2\rangle$, thus directly quantifying a “leakage rate” per gate in addition to the standard RB error per gate ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=Leakage%20errors%20occur%20when%20a,along%20with%20detuning%20of%20the)) ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=we%20use%20randomized%20benchmarking%20in,leakage%20is%20due%20to%20incoherent)). In their experiment, with unoptimized pulses, the leakage per single-qubit gate was significant (~1% after many Cliffords), but with optimized DRAG pulses they reduced it to ~$10^{-5}$ per gate ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=characterize%20single%20qubit%20gates%20in,incoherent%20heating%20of%20the%20qubit)). Another way to test for leakage is to perform two-qubit interactions and see if the expected two-level dynamics fail – for instance, if a CZ gate ideally should return both qubits to $|0/1\rangle$ states but occasionally one qubit ends up unresponsive to subsequent $X$ gates, it might be stuck in $|2\rangle$. Leakage can also be inferred by analyzing tomography: if the density matrix after a process has weight outside the computational subspace, standard two-level tomography will show an unphysical state (e.g. probabilities summing to >1). In multi-qubit circuits, leakage often is diagnosed indirectly by its effects (e.g. a syndrome measurement giving inconsistent results could hint a ancilla qubit leaked). Some QEC experiments include **leakage detection circuits** – for example, after a round of stabilizer measurements, an extra operation attempts to measure if an ancilla is in $|2\rangle$ and reset it ([
            Removing leakage-induced correlated errors in superconducting quantum error correction - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979694/#:~:text=become%20excited%2C%20creating%20leakage%20states,This%20demonstration)). However, this adds overhead, so simpler approaches like fast reset (see below) are often favored.

**Mitigation techniques:** The foremost method to reduce leakage in gates is **pulse shaping**. As noted, DRAG pulses add a negative derivative component to the drive that cancels the σ<sub>Δ</sub> (sigma-$|2\rangle$) transition drive to first order ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=non,QEC)). Chen *et al.* showed that by tuning the DRAG parameter and also detuning the pulse slightly (shifting the drive frequency midway between the $0\to1$ and $1\to2$ transitions), leakage could be suppressed to $10^{-5}$ while maintaining 99.9% gate fidelity ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=characterize%20single%20qubit%20gates%20in,incoherent%20heating%20of%20the%20qubit)). The remaining leakage in their case was attributed to *incoherent heating*, meaning random events outside their control – a reminder that even “leakage-free” pulses can’t prevent all leakage if the environment sometimes kicks the qubit up. For two-qubit gates, tailored pulse shapes are used: an **adiabatic CZ** pulse (e.g. a Gaussian flat-top flux pulse) is chosen to minimize non-adiabatic transitions. Experimental teams also calibrate *conditional π-pulses* to pump leaked qubits back: for instance, if a qubit leaks to $|2\rangle$, one can apply a $|2\rangle \to |1\rangle$ $\pi$ pulse (at the anharmonicity frequency) followed by a $|1\rangle \to |0\rangle$ pulse to bring it down. Such a **leakage reset** operation can be inserted periodically. Google’s quantum error correction experiments implemented a multi-level reset after each cycle, which drives any leaked ancilla qubit back to $|0\rangle$ ([
            Removing leakage-induced correlated errors in superconducting quantum error correction - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979694/#:~:text=uncorrelated,and%20an%20improved%20scaling%20and)). This protocol returned qubits from *all* higher levels to the ground state and was shown to reduce correlated errors and improve the logical error rate ([
            Removing leakage-induced correlated errors in superconducting quantum error correction - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979694/#:~:text=Abstract)) ([
            Removing leakage-induced correlated errors in superconducting quantum error correction - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979694/#:~:text=Subject%20terms%3A%20Quantum%20information%2C%20Qubits)). The general approach was to use an extra coupler or drive that swaps the $|2\rangle$ state to an auxiliary resonator mode where it quickly decays ([
            Removing leakage-induced correlated errors in superconducting quantum error correction - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7979694/#:~:text=become%20excited%2C%20creating%20leakage%20states,This%20demonstration)), or to sequentially drive $2\to1$ and $1\to0$ transitions. Qubits with larger anharmonicity (such as flux qubits or capacitively shunted fluxons) inherently leak less because the control drives can be more easily separated in frequency; indeed, flux qubits (which have ~GHz anharmonicity) have demonstrated very low leakage in fast gates ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=over%2099.9,lived%20as%20the%20qubit%20states)). Some proposals suggest operating leakage-prone qubits in regimes where $|2\rangle$ decays faster (though that often comes at the cost of $|1\rangle$ decaying faster too). In summary, carefully engineered pulses (DRAG, adiabatic shaping) and active leakage removal techniques are the primary strategies to combat leakage. As a last line of defense, quantum error correction itself can be made resilient to leakage by adapting decoders or including leakage detection – but this is complex, so the emphasis is on preventing leakage or resetting it quickly in the first place.

## 5. State Preparation Errors

Ideally, a quantum algorithm should start with all qubits in a well-defined basis state (usually $|0\rangle$). In practice, *state preparation and initialization* errors can occur if a qubit is not in $|0\rangle$ when assumed to be. The main cause is **residual thermal excitation**: at the millikelvin temperatures of a dilution refrigerator, the qubit’s excited state $|1\rangle$ is not completely unpopulated. A transmon at 20 mK with a 5 GHz transition might have on the order of $P(|1\rangle) \sim e^{-h f / k_B T} \sim 0.5\%$ thermal population in theory, but observed excited-state populations can be a few percent, indicating either an effective temperature higher than the fridge or extrinsic excitation sources ([Heralded State Preparation in a Superconducting Qubit  |  Phys. Rev. Lett.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050506#:~:text=resolved%20to%20below%20one%20part,fast%20qubit%20reset%20protocol%20without)). Other causes for improper initialization include: not waiting long enough for a previous qubit operation to relax (if a qubit was left in $|1\rangle$ at the end of a prior run, it might remain there), leakage from previous runs (e.g. a qubit stuck in $|2\rangle$ which then decays to $|1\rangle$ instead of $|0\rangle$), and measurement-induced excitations (readout pulses can sometimes leave a qubit in $|1\rangle$ due to slight non-QND effects).

**Diagnosing state prep errors:** The simplest diagnostic is to measure the qubit immediately after supposed preparation and see the probability of $|1\rangle$. For example, perform many trials where you *do nothing* (just idle) and then measure – any clicks of “1” indicate an initialization error. On today’s superconducting devices, this “idle error” might be on the order of 1–5%. One can also include a $\pi$ pulse half of the time before measurement to separately characterize measurement assignment error versus preparation error (this is how a **confusion matrix** for SPAM – State Preparation and Measurement – errors is obtained). If the $|1\rangle$ probability is higher than expected from thermal equilibrium, it suggests an additional noise source (like stray infrared radiation) is continuously heating the qubit. To diagnose when the excitation happens, some experiments perform a *heralding* measurement: measure the qubit in a fast, non-destructive way to check if it is $|0\rangle$; if it was $|1\rangle$, one can either discard that run or apply a feedback pulse to flip it to $|0\rangle$. Johnson *et al.* demonstrated that such heralding can suppress errors from spurious thermal population and thereby boost the effective initialization fidelity ([Heralded State Preparation in a Superconducting Qubit  |  Phys. Rev. Lett.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050506#:~:text=We%20demonstrate%20high,parameters%20to%20induce%20Purcell%20relaxation)). In their experiment on a flux qubit, they achieved an initialization to $|0\rangle$ ~99.9% of the time by post-selecting on a herald measurement (which is equivalent to a higher preparation fidelity, at the cost of discarding runs) ([Heralded State Preparation in a Superconducting Qubit  |  Phys. Rev. Lett.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050506#:~:text=resolved%20to%20below%20one%20part,fast%20qubit%20reset%20protocol%20without)). Ristè *et al.* (2012) similarly showed active reset by measuring a transmon and applying a conditional pulse to set it to $|0\rangle$ ([Heralded State Preparation in a Superconducting Qubit  |  Phys. Rev. Lett.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.050506#:~:text=See%20Also)). Another method to detect preparation errors is to run a long sequence that should return the qubit to $|0\rangle$ (like an echo sequence) and see if there’s any bias in the outcome – a bias could indicate the qubit was not in $|0\rangle$ initially.

**Mitigation techniques:** The straightforward but slow method of initialization is **passive thermalization**: wait ~5 times T<sub>1</sub> so that any excited qubit decays to ground. With T<sub>1</sub> in the 50 µs range, this means waiting a few hundred microseconds, which is acceptable in some experiments but too slow for algorithms that need rapid re-initialization (e.g. repeated QEC cycles). Therefore, **active reset** schemes have been developed. One approach is the aforementioned measurement-based feedback: measure each qubit, and if it is found in $|1\rangle$, apply a $\pi$ pulse to flip it to $|0\rangle$. This can be done in a parallel, fast way (modern systems can perform and process a readout within a few hundred nanoseconds). Another approach is a **deterministic driven reset**: use a microwave or flux drive to induce a targeted energy exchange that dumps the qubit excitation into a dissipative mode. For example, a resonator can serve as a dump mode: by modulating the qubit frequency (for a tunable qubit) one can resonantly exchange an excited qubit photon with a resonator photon, which then leaks out the resonator (Purcell decay). Recently, Chen *et al.* demonstrated a parametric flux modulation that couples an excited transmon to its readout resonator, achieving an unconditional reset in about 34 ns ([
            Rapid and unconditional parametric reset protocol for tunable superconducting qubits - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8505451/#:~:text=Our%20qubit%20reset%20protocol%20is,the%20qubit%20is%20excited%2C%20as)) ([
            Rapid and unconditional parametric reset protocol for tunable superconducting qubits - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8505451/#:~:text=illustrated%20in%20Fig,rate%20of%20the%20readout%20resonator)). This works even if the qubit is leaked to $|2\rangle$, by depleting that as well ([
            Rapid and unconditional parametric reset protocol for tunable superconducting qubits - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8505451/#:~:text=34%20ns,%CE%BA%20r%20or%20dispersive%20shift)). The advantage of such schemes is that they do not require measuring the qubit (no classical feedback latency) and can be faster than T<sub>1</sub> by an order of magnitude. Another example is a “Double-drive” reset where a drive at frequency $f_{1,2}$ (the $|1\rangle$–$|2\rangle$ transition) and $f_{0,1}$ are applied simultaneously to induce a two-photon transition from $|1\rangle$ to $|0\rangle$ or otherwise speed up relaxation ([How to Dramatically Increase the Initialization Fidelity of Your Qubits ...](https://www.quantum-machines.co/blog/https-www-quantum-machines-co-blog-increasing-qubit-initialization-fidelity-with-qua/#:~:text=How%20to%20Dramatically%20Increase%20the,decay%20to%20their%20thermal%20state)). Ensuring a **cold environment** is also important: filtering input lines to block room-temperature thermal noise and infrared shielding of the qubit chip (e.g. with infrared-absorbing filters and enclosures) helps keep the qubit’s effective temperature low. Despite these efforts, many devices still report a small but non-zero $|1\rangle$ population at base temperature – indicating either a higher local temperature or continuous radiation absorption. As a mitigation, experiments often perform a quick pre-measurement or a $\pi$ pulse at the start of an algorithm to reduce this error: for instance, one might do a “Ramsey-style” sequence where any residual excited population is driven to oscillate and partially cancel out. Ultimately, active reset (either measurement-based or engineered dissipation) is the preferred solution in larger quantum processors. It’s worth noting that state preparation errors and measurement errors together are often referred to as **SPAM errors** and can be treated with calibration or mitigation if they are stable. For example, if one knows that 2% of the time the qubit starts in $|1\rangle$, one can incorporate that into analysis or apply an extra preparatory pulse.

## 6. Measurement (Readout) Errors

Reading out the state of a superconducting qubit is typically done via a dispersive readout: the qubit is coupled to a microwave resonator, and the qubit state ($|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$) shifts the resonator frequency slightly. By interrogating the resonator with a microwave pulse and measuring the transmitted/reflected signal, one can infer the qubit state from the measured voltage. The fidelity of this single-shot readout is limited by several factors: **amplifier noise**, **measurement time (integration window)**, **state transitions during measurement**, and **crosstalk or mode overlap** in multi-qubit readouts.

**Origin of readout errors:** A predominant error mechanism is qubit relaxation *during* the measurement pulse ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=In%20superconducting%20circuits%2C%20the%20state,been%20exploited%20to%20decrease%20the)). If the qubit decays from $|1\rangle$ to $|0\rangle$ while the measurement is ongoing, the outcome can be wrong: the detector might register an intermediate signal and misidentify it, or even if it correctly sees the decay, the classical assignment might count that as $|0\rangle$ (thus a bit-flip error in the measurement record). This error is more likely if the measurement takes a long time compared to T<sub>1</sub>. Indeed, on short timescales the probability of this error grows approximately linearly with the ratio $\tau_r / T_1$ ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=qubit23%20,limited)). Modern systems try to reduce $\tau_r$ (the readout duration) to mitigate this. Another source of error is the **noise of the amplifier and detection chain** – the separation between the “0” and “1” signals may be small compared to noise, causing random assignment errors. This is essentially a signal-to-noise issue; using a quantum-limited amplifier (like a Josephson parametric amplifier or traveling-wave parametric amplifier) at the millikelvin stage can dramatically improve this by reducing added noise. Without such amplifiers, typical assignment fidelity might be ~99% for single-qubit (two-outcome) readout ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=remains%20a%20challenge,50%20Further%20improvement%20in%20the)), whereas with them fidelities >99.5% have been achieved ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=levels.%20Using%20a%20machine,limited%20amplifier)). Other error sources include **non-QND (quantum non-demolition) effects**: ideally measuring $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$ should not disturb the state, but in practice, a strong readout pulse can sometimes stimulate transitions. For example, if too many photons enter the resonator, the dispersive approximation can break down and the qubit might absorb a photon (exciting to $|1\rangle$ or $|2\rangle$) – this is a *measurement-induced excitation*. That leads to an error if one was measuring expecting the qubit to remain in its state. Additionally, there is **cross-resonator or cross-talk** error in multi-qubit readout: if resonators are frequency-multiplexed through the same line, the signals can interfere. In some cases, the readout of qubit A can cause a pull on qubit B’s resonator (due to residual coupling or amplifier saturation), effectively reducing fidelity for qubit B. Measurement crosstalk is a known issue, e.g. readout resonators in transmon devices can **interact unintentionally** if not well isolated ([Crosstalk diagnosis for the next generation of quantum processors – Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/views/qv-2020-10-29-46/#:~:text=diverse%20as%20the%20physical%20architectures,4)) – this can lead to false counts like qubit B’s readout being shifted depending on qubit A’s state.

**Diagnostic methods:** The basic characterization is to build the **confusion matrix**: prepare $|0\rangle$ many times, measure, and compute $P(m|0)$ for $m \in \{0,1\}$; do likewise for $|1\rangle$ preparations. This yields readout assignment errors directly (e.g. “readout 0 as 1” and vice versa). Many groups report the *assignment fidelity* as $F = 1 - (p(0|1)+p(1|0))/2$. If the qubit has considerable residual $|1\rangle$ population, one has to be careful to prepare a pure $|1\rangle$ state (usually by a $\pi$ pulse from ground) to measure $p(m|1)$. One can also check for **QND-ness**: prepare $|1\rangle$, measure it, then immediately measure again. Ideally, one should get “1” then “1” again if the measurement does not destroy the excitation. Any tendency to get “1” then “0” indicates the measurement itself caused relaxation or an error (excluding the normal T<sub>1</sub> decay that could have happened in between – so by varying the delay between the two measurements, one can separate measurement-induced decay from natural decay). If the readout is too slow, one diagnostic is to plot assignment error vs readout duration – typically, as readout time shortens, the decay during readout error drops, but if it’s too short the SNR might not be sufficient, causing a different kind of error (misclassification). There is thus an optimal point. This was quantified in a recent study: the error from relaxation grows with $\tau_r/T_1$ linearly for short $\tau_r$ ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=qubit23%20,limited)), while the separation fidelity improves with longer $\tau_r$, so one must balance them. Monitoring amplifier saturation is also important: if multiple qubits are read simultaneously, one can try reading them individually vs together to see if the error rates increase when simultaneous – that would indicate a shared resource limit (like the amplifier or ADC dynamic range) causing crosstalk.

**Mitigation techniques:** To combat measurement errors, several hardware and software strategies are used. On the hardware side, **Purcell filters** are implemented to allow fast readout without shortening T<sub>1</sub>: a Purcell filter is typically a band-pass or band-stop filter in the readout line that decouples the qubit from the resonator at the qubit frequency, thus preventing qubit energy from leaking out through the resonator except during the intended measurement pulse ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=Various%20high,limited)) ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=filters26%2C27%2C28%20and%20quantum,ns%20has%20been%20demonstrated%2012%2C13)). This enables one to use a strongly coupled resonator (for fast response) while still having a long T<sub>1</sub> in idle mode. **Quantum-limited amplifiers** greatly improve fidelity by lowering noise – nearly all high-fidelity readouts now use Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) or their variants. Combining a JPA and Purcell filtering, **>99% fidelity in under 100 ns** has been shown in some cases ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=filters26%2C27%2C28%20and%20quantum,ns%20has%20been%20demonstrated%2012%2C13)). In fact, Chen *et al.* (2023) demonstrated 99.5% fidelity in 140 ns *without* a quantum-limited amp by using a two-tone readout and machine-learning classification ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=levels.%20Using%20a%20machine,limited%20amplifier)), but generally, a good amplifier is the more straightforward path. **Optimizing readout pulse shape** can also help – e.g. using a square envelope for speed, or a two-step readout where a short strong pulse quickly distinguishes $|1\rangle$ then a longer integration confirms it. If measurement-induced excitation is an issue, one can lower the photon number in the resonator (trading some speed for QND fidelity) or use a “buffer” cavity (as in the “quantum bifurcation amplifier” scheme) to keep the qubit isolated from large photon number swings. Multiplexed readouts require careful frequency spacing of resonators to avoid collisions, and isolation between lines (sometimes isolators or directional couplers are used to separate signals). **Software mitigations** of readout error are also employed: since readout errors are a classical post-processing issue, one can apply a measured confusion matrix to *unbias* results (error mitigation). For example, if you know 2% of $|1\rangle$ are mistaken for $|0\rangle$, you can statistically correct for that in the final counts of an algorithm (assuming errors are independent and symmetric). This is standard in many NISQ experiments – they’ll calibrate a readout error matrix and then invert it to get a best estimate of the true probabilities. Furthermore, fast-feedback schemes can alleviate errors in QEC contexts: if an ancilla readout reports an error, one might double-check quickly to reduce risks of a false syndrome caused by readout error (at the cost of more complexity). Looking forward, novel approaches like using **photon-counting detectors** instead of amplifiers (to avoid amplifier noise entirely) are being explored ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=Single,qubit%20using%20a%20thermal%20detector)), which could yield essentially zero misclassification error at the expense of more hardware complexity.

In summary, measurement errors in SC qubits, while still on the order of 1% in many devices (worse than gate errors), are being aggressively improved. Reducing the readout time $\tau_r$ is crucial – by using higher-power readouts with proper isolation, the community has shown that one can approach the physical limits set by T<sub>1</sub> decay ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=qubit23%20,limited)). As noted in one report, with Purcell filters and near-quantum-limited amplifiers, readout fidelity >99% in <100 ns has been achieved ([Transmon qubit readout fidelity at the threshold for quantum error correction without a quantum-limited amplifier | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-023-00689-6#:~:text=filters26%2C27%2C28%20and%20quantum,ns%20has%20been%20demonstrated%2012%2C13)). This is encouraging for fault-tolerant operation, since quantum error correction demands high-fidelity, rapid measurements to extract syndrome information.

## 7. Crosstalk and Correlated Noise in Multi-Qubit Systems

As quantum processors scale up, **crosstalk** and **correlated noise** become significant challenges. Ideally, errors should occur independently on each qubit; in reality, qubits can influence each other in unwanted ways, and global noise sources can induce errors on multiple qubits simultaneously. Such correlated errors can violate the assumptions of error correction (which usually assumes random independent errors) ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=be%20less%20than%200,lost%20and%20the%20algorithm%20fails)).

**Crosstalk errors** refer to any situation where an operation on qubit A causes an error on qubit B. In superconducting devices, several forms of crosstalk are common ([Crosstalk diagnosis for the next generation of quantum processors – Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/views/qv-2020-10-29-46/#:~:text=diverse%20as%20the%20physical%20architectures,4)):

- **Control crosstalk**: Microwave drive lines are not perfectly isolated, so a pulse intended for qubit A can leak and rotate qubit B by a small angle. Similarly, flux bias lines can have mutual inductance – pulsing a flux line for qubit A can slightly shift the frequency of qubit B. These manifest as off-target rotations or frequency shifts (a context-dependent error).
- **Measurement crosstalk**: As discussed, simultaneous readouts can interfere – e.g. readout resonators coupling to each other or saturating a common amplifier, causing one qubit’s measurement to affect another’s outcome ([Crosstalk diagnosis for the next generation of quantum processors – Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/views/qv-2020-10-29-46/#:~:text=architecture%20such%20as%20IBM%E2%80%99s%20,4)).
- **Always-on coupling**: The residual $ZZ$ coupling between qubits (or higher-order couplings via bus resonators) means that an operation on one qubit (which changes its state) can impart a phase error on another if not mitigated. In effect, the qubits are not perfectly independent Hamiltonians.
- **Classical cross-coupling**: Noise on control lines (e.g. flux noise on a bias line) could be correlated if the lines share electronics or physical routing. For example, a voltage fluctuation on a common power supply might shift biases on several qubits together – this is less studied but can happen.

**Correlated environment noise**: Apart from direct channel crosstalk, multiple qubits can be affected simultaneously by a common external noise source. Notably, **ionizing radiation (cosmic rays)** can create bursts of quasiparticles that hit many qubits across a chip at once, causing a cluster of T<sub>1</sub> events in a short time ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=This%20paper%20explains%20how%20cosmic,the%20effects%20of%20radiation%2C%20but)). This is a temporally and spatially correlated error – many qubits lose coherence nearly simultaneously. Similarly, fluctuations in temperature or vibrations of the chip (mechanical vibrations can modulate all flux biases slightly, for instance) could create low-frequency noise that is common to many qubits (e.g. a periodic vibration might cause simultaneous dephasing oscillations) ([Mechanically induced correlated errors on superconducting qubits ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48230-3#:~:text=Mechanically%20induced%20correlated%20errors%20on,mitigation)). In fact, a recent study reported **mechanically induced correlated errors** where vibrations (from a pulse tube cooler in the fridge) led to coherent T<sub>1</sub> fluctuations across multiple qubits, all with a common periodicity ([Mechanically induced correlated errors on superconducting qubits ...](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48230-3#:~:text=Mechanically%20induced%20correlated%20errors%20on,mitigation)). Another example of correlated noise is global magnetic field fluctuations – if an external magnetic field (from stray fields or PSU noise) couples to all qubit loops, it can cause correlated flux noise. However, the best-documented and worrisome correlated noise in superconducting qubits is from radiation: one paper provided *direct evidence* of cosmic-ray-induced errors spanning multiple qubits ([Direct evidence for cosmic-ray-induced correlated errors in ... - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04245#:~:text=arXiv%20arxiv,ionizing%20radiations%20and%20cosmic%20rays)). In that experiment, they synchronized a cosmic ray detector with a quantum chip and saw that when a cosmic particle was detected, multiple qubits experienced errors in unison ([Direct evidence for cosmic-ray-induced correlated errors in ... - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04245#:~:text=arXiv%20arxiv,ionizing%20radiations%20and%20cosmic%20rays)).

**Diagnosing crosstalk and correlations:** A variety of techniques have been developed. For static or slowly varying crosstalk, one can build a **crosstalk matrix** by measuring how much a control on qubit A affects qubit B. For example, send a known small pulse to qubit A and measure qubit B’s state change via tomography. Repeating for all pairs yields an “error per control” map. Many systems perform a calibration step called “cross talk cancellation” where they intentionally measure these cross effects. Another approach is **simultaneous randomized benchmarking**: run RB on qubit A alone to get an error rate, then run RB on A and a spectator qubit B at the same time. If B’s presence (and simultaneous driving) increases A’s error or vice versa, that indicates crosstalk. This method captures dynamic crosstalk (like competing microwave drives affecting each other or AC Stark shifts induced by simultaneous operations). To get more detailed information (like specific process errors), **Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography (GST)** can be used ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=We%20used%20simultaneous%20gate%20set,a%20hierarchy%20of%20models%20to)). Rudinger *et al.* (2021) applied GST with operations on two qubits concurrently to differentiate types of crosstalk errors ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=An%20important%20class%20of%20errors,characterizing%20such%20errors%20are%20now)) ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=We%20used%20simultaneous%20gate%20set,a%20hierarchy%20of%20models%20to)). They could tell, for example, if the crosstalk was a consistent coherent coupling (which would appear as a specific unitary in the two-qubit process) or a stochastic, random coupling. They introduced hypothesis tests to see if adding a particular crosstalk error term significantly improves the model fit, thus identifying the error ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=which%20is%20a%20protocol%20for,to%20understand%20and%20improve%20hardware)). For environmental correlations, one diagnostic is long-term monitoring: measure T<sub>1</sub> or error rates of multiple qubits continuously and compute cross-correlation functions. If qubit errors coincide more often than chance, there is a common cause. Google’s team did this by simultaneously recording T<sub>1</sub> for many qubits and indeed saw bursts where 5–8 qubits’ T<sub>1</sub> would drop at the same time, strongly pointing to cosmic ray events ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=This%20paper%20explains%20how%20cosmic,the%20effects%20of%20radiation%2C%20but)). Installing radiation sensors and comparing their outputs to qubit error logs is another direct method ([Synchronous Detection of Cosmic Rays and Correlated Errors in ...](https://inspirehep.net/literature/2755380#:~:text=Synchronous%20Detection%20of%20Cosmic%20Rays,accomplished%20this%20by%20synchronously)). For slower drifts (like 1/f noise that might be spatially correlated), statistical analysis over many hours or days can reveal correlation lengths – e.g. if all qubits on one chip see their frequency drift in the same direction over hours, that could be a global temperature drift or magnetic field change.

**Mitigation techniques:** Crosstalk that is deterministic and well-characterized can be *actively corrected*. For instance, as mentioned, if qubit A’s $X$ pulse causes a Z rotation on qubit B, one can apply a compensating Z rotation (either by software phase correction or an actual pulse) to B whenever A is pulsed ([Crosstalk diagnosis for the next generation of quantum processors – Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/views/qv-2020-10-29-46/#:~:text=components%20are%20coupled,But%20such%20approaches%20are)). This is feasible for pairwise crosstalk that is consistent. However, as systems grow, characterizing every pair or higher-order interaction becomes daunting (it scales combinatorially) ([Crosstalk diagnosis for the next generation of quantum processors – Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/views/qv-2020-10-29-46/#:~:text=their%20natural%20frequencies%20well%20apart,those%20possibilities%20are%20physically%20manifested)). Thus, architectural solutions are pursued: **isolation through design**. This includes physical spacing (keep qubits further apart or use shielding structures between them), frequency detuning (design qubit frequencies to minimize unintended resonances) ([Crosstalk diagnosis for the next generation of quantum processors – Quantum](https://quantum-journal.org/views/qv-2020-10-29-46/#:~:text=superconducting%20circuits%2C%20one%20may%20also,those%20possibilities%20are%20physically%20manifested)), and using tunable couplers or filters that only allow intentional interactions. For example, putting qubits on different chip layers or using 3D wiring can reduce direct microwave crosstalk. In fixed-frequency architectures, resonators and qubits can be arranged so that drive lines are orthogonal and have minimal overlap. Even the packaging can matter (to avoid chip modes that couple multiple qubits). On the control electronics side, ensuring that each control line has its own dedicated DAC channel (with minimal cross-coupling in the electronics) and good isolation is standard. If a particular cross-coupling is known (say 5% of pulse amplitude bleeds to neighbor), one can pre-compensate the waveforms. This feedforward cancellation is effectively creating the inverse crosstalk matrix and has been demonstrated in some systems to significantly reduce cross errors.

For correlated environmental noise like cosmic rays, **shielding** is a mitigation: surrounding the qubit chip with lead or heavy metal can attenuate some background radiation (e.g. cosmic muons, environmental gammas). Experiments at MIT Lincoln Lab and others showed that added shielding improved qubit coherence stability somewhat, but it cannot stop all high-energy events (and cosmic rays can create secondary particles *inside* the shield). Another approach is to engineer the substrate for rapid quasiparticle evacuation. Martinis (2021) proposed introducing heavy metal layers to downconvert energetic phonons (from a radiation hit) into many low-energy phonons, confining damage to a small area ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=Error,mechanism%20can%20be%20reduced%20by)). This is sometimes called “phonon trapping” or **phonon downconversion** – recent work showed that adding phonon scattering structures on the chip can *localize* the effect of a radiation hit to a smaller region, so not all qubits are affected ([Quasiparticle Dynamics in a Superconducting Qubit Irradiated by a ...](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.060602#:~:text=broken%20Cooper%20pairs%2C%20or%20quasiparticles,energy)). **Quasiparticle traps** (tiny normal-metal patches near each junction) can also soak up quasiparticles faster, shortening the burst duration. None of these fully eliminate the issue, but they can reduce the correlated error probability by orders of magnitude according to simulations ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=superconducting%20qubits%20by%20modeling%20the,state)). For correlated 1/f noise that might affect many qubits, echo techniques help – if all qubits experience a common slow fluctuation, simultaneously applying echo pulses will refocus that common mode (this is effectively treating it as a global clock error that you can correct). In a multi-qubit circuit, one could also envision using *reference qubits* that are sacrificed to specifically monitor common noise – e.g. a qubit left idle to measure global flux drift, whose measurement is then used to correct the others dynamically.

At the software level, **error mitigation and tailored decoding** can handle some correlated errors. If you know errors tend to come in bursts (like cosmic ray strikes), the QEC decoder can be tuned to recognize that pattern and not treat those as independent errors (there are research efforts in developing decoders resilient to burst errors or leakage errors). In the near term, simply flagging and discarding experiments where a big burst occurred (detected via an ancilla or an off-qubit sensor) is a way to avoid corrupt data – this is akin to post-selecting runs without large correlated events.

To conclude, while tremendous progress has been made in extending coherence (T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>) and improving gate fidelities in superconducting qubits, diagnosing and mitigating noise remains a critical ongoing effort. By systematically characterizing noise sources – from microscopic two-level defects and quasiparticles to control crosstalk and measurement errors – researchers have developed a toolset of experimental techniques (spectroscopy, benchmarking, tomography, etc.) to pinpoint error mechanisms. Open-access studies have shed light on, for example, the microscopic origin of flux noise in surface spins ([Identification of the Local Sources of Paramagnetic Noise in Superconducting Qubit Devices Fabricated on  Substrates Using Density-Functional Calculations  |  Phys. Rev. Lett.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.017001#:~:text=microscopic%20origin%20of%20noise%20remains,these%20magnetic%20defects%20are%20proposed)) and the impact of cosmic rays on multi-qubit error bursts ([Saving superconducting quantum processors from decay and correlated errors generated by gamma and cosmic rays | npj Quantum Information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00431-0#:~:text=This%20paper%20explains%20how%20cosmic,the%20effects%20of%20radiation%2C%20but)), guiding the community toward better materials and architectures. Techniques like DRAG pulses, echoed gate schemes, and fast active resets, supported by extensive literature ([](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.020501#:~:text=characterize%20single%20qubit%20gates%20in,incoherent%20heating%20of%20the%20qubit)) ([

As devices grow in size, emphasis is shifting to diagnosing **correlations** in errors – recent works use advanced protocols to detect and distinguish crosstalk errors ([Experimental Characterization of Crosstalk Errors with Simultaneous Gate Set Tomography  |  PRX Quantum](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.040338#:~:text=An%20important%20class%20of%20errors,characterizing%20such%20errors%20are%20now)) and have even directly captured high-energy radiation events causing multi-qubit failures ([Direct evidence for cosmic-ray-induced correlated errors in ... - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04245#:~:text=arXiv%20arxiv,ionizing%20radiations%20and%20cosmic%20rays)). The practical diagnostics prioritized in experiments – such as simultaneous error measurements, automated calibration routines, and stability benchmarks – ensure that proposed mitigation strategies are grounded in real data. By continuously iterating between identifying noise sources and implementing fixes, the superconducting qubit community is steadily chipping away at noise, inching closer to the fault-tolerance threshold on larger scales. Each improvement, whether it’s a materials purification that reduces TLS density or a new pulse sequence that cancels crosstalk, is a step toward more reliable quantum processors in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era and beyond ([
